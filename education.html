      <span>2011 â€“ 2016</span>
      <p>My journey started at SK Jeram Tekoh â€” a small but meaningful place that holds many childhood memories. It was here that I learned the basics of education, made my first friends, and discovered the joy of learning. The teachers who guided me with patience and care played a big part in shaping my character and confidence at a young age.</p>

      <h3>SEKOLAH MENENGAH KEBANGSAAN CHIKU 2</h3>
      <span>2017 â€“ 2021</span>
      <p>I continued my secondary education at SMK Chiku 2, where I spent some of the most memorable years of my life. These were the years that shaped me into a more confident, responsible, and goal-driven person. It was also where I sat for my Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) â€” a major milestone in my academic journey. Through challenges, friendships, and achievements, SMK Chiku 2 taught me the true meaning of hard work, growth, and self-belief.</p>

      <p>Currently, I am in my final semester of the Diploma in Information Management at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Machang. This course has given me knowledge in records management, data organization, library systems, and digital information tools. It has shaped my understanding of how valuable information is in every sector today.</p>
